The magic behind Sample Rate to Playback for SNES pitch registers is:
Sample Rate * .128=16/125

You know that 32000HZ sample is $1000 pitch register value
$1000 = 4096
4096/32000 = .128 = 16/125

Then say your like me and have a sample at 22050 Hz and you want to play it back as you sampled it. simple:
22050 Hz * .128 = 2822.4 ~ 2822 = $b06 TAH-DAH
