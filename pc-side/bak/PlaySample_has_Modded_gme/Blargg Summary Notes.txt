Summary Notes
=============

SPC Program @ $1000
Sample @ $200

All emulators use a reader object to access file data, allowing it to be
stored in a regular file, compressed archive, memory, or generated
on-the-fly. Again, the library can be kept free of the particulars of
file access and changes required to support new formats.

* Can read music data from file, memory, or custom reader function/class

This means that you *must* check for NULL when creating a
library object with the new operator.

* Load from a block of memory rather than a file with gme_load_data()

When loading a music file in the wrong emulator or trying to load a
non-music file, gme_wrong_file_type is returned. You can check for this
error in C++ like this:

  gme_err_t err = gme_open_file( path, &emu );
  if ( err == gme_wrong_file_type )
    ...

    "Your
code should be prepared for any combination of available and unavailable
fields, as a particular music file might not use all of the supported
fields listed above."
