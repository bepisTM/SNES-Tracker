23:21 <@bazz> wow, I have a moderately working cross compiled win32 STD from Linux, running in WINE!! (hehe)
23:45 <@bazz> Just ran it on my father's WinXP laptop as well!! Granted, there's some (a lot) of kinks that need to be worked out ^_^ let me see...
23:45 <@bazz> For some reason, the memory view gfx are being printed .. from the wrong location.. im not sure why
23:46 <@bazz> audio buffer was a little choppy, I'm assuming due to slower system (pop's laptop) or emulation .. I need to add the ability to control the size of the audio buffer from the audio config window
23:47 <@bazz> and my port of NFD window's implementation is incomplete (no file filtering.. didn't test multi-select)
23:48 <@bazz> --- 7z / unrar needs to get properly checked / verified
23:48 <@bazz> boost::filesystem processing of (*.spc) files in a target directory needs to be verified
23:49 <@bazz> and UNICODE -- I never really prepared to properly support unicode filenames -- should at one point experiment what happens when one loads, how to handle it -- consider eventual support? 
23:49 <@bazz> Linux -- I recall not being to open the audio window after closing it (config)
23:59 <@bazz> Have to get win32 make to produce .exe
23:59 <@bazz> automate copying of DLL files

Why didn't libGME_M need any actual IMPORT/EXPORT defs?
