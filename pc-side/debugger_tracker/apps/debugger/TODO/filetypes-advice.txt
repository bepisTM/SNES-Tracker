12:32 < blaze_pascal> that moment when you realize you should have had a versioned file format from the start
12:32 -!- A-zu-ra is now known as A-zu-ra|DC
12:32 < bazz> blaze_pascal: thanks for the tip (considers for snes tracker)
12:33 < blaze_pascal> :)
12:33 <@charlotte> Mxy seems p good too i guess, like a muted Sxx
12:33 < blaze_pascal> another good tip is to use a standardized chunk format, like RIFF
12:33 < bazz> I inherently understand why, but wouldn't mind it being explained
12:34 < blaze_pascal> it's just very convenient to parse and easy to verify that you have correctly parsed it imo
12:34 < blaze_pascal> good support for it
12:34 <@charlotte> awwwww u can't use two or more Txy

12:35 <@charlotte> that woulda been pretty cool

12:35 <@charlotte> Txy's a good one i should use more often, usually when i can't be arsed upping speed i just do 0xy lol
12:35 < blaze_pascal> and most datastructures can be serialized as nested RIFF
12:39 <@charlotte> when's nicetas implementing hardware sweep as an instrument macro
12:39 <@charlotte> u can do crazy shit w/ that
12:40 < Chromaryu> No hostmask r/n

12:58 < DrMerio|NSA> That moment when the entire computer freezes and you have to shut it down
13:01 < blaze_pascal> bazz: also good when parsing out metadata etc., because you can regard chunks that you aren't interested in as black boxes
13:02 < blaze_pascal> unlike most module format where to get the correct offset of some metadata you must have parsed all the data up to that point
13:02 < blaze_pascal> or added up the offsets at least :)

13:12 < bazz> blaze_pascal: you will have to add offsets in RIFF as well, I presume
13:12 < bazz> you need to read the RIFF chunk header to know how big it is.. there's no difference there
13:13 < bazz> maybe I misunderstood you
13:13 < Schallwelle> newsflash there is an external handy tool to make xpmck made vgm files frame accurate
13:14 < Schallwelle> plot twist now i'm used to stay at 150bpm lmao
13:16 -!- ReddehWow [webchat@05472f6c.skybroadband.com] has joined #botb
13:16 < blaze_pascal> bazz: the think is you can have tons of chunks and nested riffs. to get "past" a riff chunk you just need to read the header and then jump <length> bytes
13:17 < blaze_pascal> in wav for example, maybe i am just interested in the fmt chunk, which describes the file format
13:17 < ReddehWow> hi im interested in joining an hour spriting battle if anyones hosting one ^_^
13:17 < blaze_pascal> then i can skip all the other chunks
13:17 < bazz> Schallwelle: what is the tool? what must be done? 
13:17 < [^_^]> ReddehWow, hang around, there will be some eventually :P

13:19 < Schallwelle> it's part of a vgm tools bundle called....vgmtools yes
13:19 < Schallwelle> and not vgmtool, vgmtoolS
13:19 < blaze_pascal> the chunks then may specify their own subformat. if there is some nested information it is probably a list of chunks in itself
13:19 < Schallwelle> goddammit sega scene what are You doing ?derp
13:19 < Schallwelle> ?derp
13:19 < Sylphy> ヽ( ﾟ ワ 。)ノ
13:20 < blaze_pascal> but to parse the fmt chunk in a wave file, i just need to know the format of the fmt chunk and the name of the chunk ("fmt ")
13:20 < blaze_pascal> no need to figure out how to calculate the length of other chunks or so

13:21 < bazz> blaze_pascal: yes I get it
13:22 < bazz> have a main master header with versioning ... incorporate the others in chunks with their own headers that at least tell their size .. model after RIFF order .. got it

13:23 < blaze_pascal> yep that all makes sense
13:23 < blaze_pascal> already sounds more pleasant to work with than 99% of module formats :D

13:25 < blaze_pascal> then you can implement easily implement backwards compatible parsers for the chunks with fall-through switches
13:27 < blaze_pascal> case VERSION1: <convert version 1 to version 2>; case VERSION2: <convert version 2 to version 3>; case [...]
13:27 < blaze_pascal> notice the lack of break; :)

14:12 < Raijin> one jump you can try in megaman x is the jump to boomer kuwanger's heart tank without ice or a boomerang weapon
14:12 < Raijin> similar jump in blizzard buffalo stage in x3, to the robot part
14:13 < Raijin> if you wanna try something hard

14:14 < Raijin> just do it without upgrades

14:28 < vilxdryad> yea raijin i actually do all of those on speed runs lol i hope by the one in blizzard buffalo you are referring are to reach the legs upgrade and not the tank upgrade lmao indeed Schallwelle that game was awesome, also it did not need to demand walljumping to make jumps already hard lol Joltik always do things <3
14:28 < Joltik> "<Raijin> dat spc note silencing before being able to initiate a new note tho" actually it's mostly a sound design choice in that
14:30 < Raijin> vilxdryad, you can do that from under the overhang where you get the leg upgrade too

14:31 < Raijin> joltik, i meant you can tell when the spc has to do it, like the quick note slide section
14:31 < Joltik> again, intentionally bigger gaps
14:31 < Joltik> i could have made them smaller
14:31 < Joltik> but i didnt because i liked the sound for some reason
14:32 < Raijin> ok, like it sounds fine, i was just pointing it out :p
14:32 < vilxdryad> i never figured that before owo trying it this thursday when doing a series speed run : )
14:33 < Raijin> i used to speed run x1 2 and 3.
14:33 < Raijin> you can do a fun thing with zero
14:33 < Raijin> in buffalo stage, where the ride armor part is, go into the leftmost wall and switch to zero and you can get him stuck in the wall
14:34 < Raijin> actually i cant remember if it was the ride armor part or a sub tank there, but whichever
14:37 < Raijin> oh, to get him into the wall. you have to fully charge and swing the saber. when he swings the saber, just mash the jump button
14:37 < Raijin> i almost forgot to mention that

15:21 < Schallwelle> :D
15:22 <@puke7> in an attempt to get good at them i realize i think they are very boring
15:22 < Schallwelle> i played MK, KI and SF as a child all the time

15:22 < vilxdryad> sheng long its the infamous secret character created by a bad regionalism

15:22 < Schallwelle> ahh
15:22 < vilxdryad> fact auto-correct
15:22 <@puke7> i played a lot of tekken 3
15:22 < Schallwelle> i was thinking Joltik typo'd shen long from dragonball :D
15:22 < Schallwelle> haha tekken 3!!!
15:22 < Schallwelle> looking back, that game was so bad lmao
15:22 < Schallwelle> but fun :D
15:23 <@puke7> and street fighter ex+ alpha on ps1
15:23 < A-zu-ra> I used to own Tekken 3 for the PS1
15:23 < Schallwelle> ^

15:24 < vilxdryad> while older the better
15:24 < vilxdryad> i actually play it online lol
15:24 <@puke7> yeah smash bros bores me too
15:24 < Schallwelle> i will never decide between classic and melee
15:24 < vilxdryad> the n64 one
15:24 < Schallwelle> they're both supergood
15:24 < Schallwelle> =)
15:24 <@puke7> yay one screen. mahs buttons
15:24 < Schallwelle> puke7 did You play it with others? :D
15:24 < vilxdryad> i am still preferring the original better
15:24 <@puke7> i've only played it with others
15:24 < Schallwelle> =))
15:24 <@puke7> i've been suckered into tournaments
15:24 < Schallwelle> lol
15:24 <@puke7> usually make it to round 2
15:25 < A-zu-ra> gonna be that weirdo and say that I personally like smash
15:25 < Schallwelle> well hey it's no obligation to like it
15:25 < Schallwelle> wtf
15:25 < Schallwelle> :)
15:25 <@puke7> but i still think it's dumb and boring
15:25 < vilxdryad> smashing what, A-zu-ra?
15:25 < Schallwelle> YOu're free to do that puke xD
15:25 < A-zu-ra> Super Smash Bros.
15:25 < Schallwelle> uhm
15:25 < Schallwelle> we just said we like it as well
15:25  * A-zu-ra can never get into any fighting game that requires memorizing a series of long button strings
15:25 < vilxdryad> let's play it online to see how good you are!
15:25 < Schallwelle> how can You be 'the' weirdo
15:25 < Schallwelle> ?derp
15:25 < Sylphy> ヽ( ﾟ ワ 。)ノ
15:26 < vilxdryad> there are kind of gamers that can get over fighting games = D
15:26 < A-zu-ra> Just because I said I liked it doesn't mean that I'm necessarily pro at it
15:26 < Schallwelle> wow

15:26  * tischslampe takes off his glove and whips Schallwelle's face
15:26 < Schallwelle> no this is cowboy style, You slap the opponent with the glove to show You want a duel, malmen
15:26 < tischslampe> en garde
15:27 < Schallwelle> ah wow
15:27 < Schallwelle> i was already thinking You don't know
15:27 < Schallwelle> xD
15:27 < Yuki-chan> That's not cowboy style
15:27 < tischslampe> this is how we did it in the aristocrat society
15:27 < Yuki-chan> That's 18th century french court style
15:27 < Schallwelle> it is now , by my just word!!
15:27 < tischslampe> Yuki-chan: yes
15:27 < tischslampe> :)
15:27 <@puke7> xD
15:27 < Schallwelle> it is just. deal with it
15:27 < Schallwelle> lel
15:27 < Yuki-chan> cowboys don't wear gloves....
15:27 < Schallwelle> they do now ok
15:27 < tischslampe> they did it with their boots instead
15:27 < Yuki-chan> You can't shoot a gun with a glove!
15:27 < Schallwelle> You can always shoot my... fuck
15:28 < vilxdryad> do you have you emulator setted up ?
15:28 < A-zu-ra> idk, I'm just reluctant to play fighting games in general
15:28 < tischslampe> Yuki-chan: afaik it was the french way of insulting
15:28 < tischslampe> but im not sure
15:28 < A-zu-ra> tends to be the case when you're surrounded by no one but professional-grade players
15:28 < Yuki-chan> Yeah
15:28 < Schallwelle> hey good idea let's netplay from europe to america so we'll have tons of lag <3
15:28 < Schallwelle> ?derp
15:28 < Sylphy> ヽ( ﾟ ワ 。)ノ
15:28 < tischslampe> i think the outcome was a sword duel, most often though
15:29 < vilxdryad> yea, it still is fair if we play on a remote server lol
15:29 < Schallwelle> i'd rek You all with Samus B)
15:29 < Schallwelle> my friends forced me to play only 'bad' characters so they have a chance lmao
15:29 < vilxdryad> you might be walljumped by mario
15:29 < Schallwelle> wow what a diss
15:29 < vilxdryad> yea me too lol
15:29 < Schallwelle> x3
15:31 < Schallwelle> i will """cheat""" tbh fam
15:31 < Schallwelle> i will get the plasma beam from draygon in maridia
15:31 < Schallwelle> do the reset trick with the VAR-beam
15:31 < Schallwelle> and get 100000000000 energy tanks
15:31 < Schallwelle> and then go and whip ridleys dragon ass
15:31 < Schallwelle> muahaha
15:31  * tischslampe cluless
15:31 < vilxdryad> i were used to win even using polygons lol
15:31 < vilxdryad> lmao
15:31 < Schallwelle> vilxdryad will probably know :D
15:32 < Schallwelle> wow i never playe with polygons
15:32 < vilxdryad> yea, it felt awesome to know =' )
15:32 < Yuki-chan> Schallwelle, you might as well use savestates then!
15:32 < Yuki-chan> ;)
15:32 < Schallwelle> no, also i'm playing on the real system You dong
15:32 < vilxdryad> he has feelings
15:32 < Schallwelle> no emulator for me, unless it's something i don't own
15:32 < tischslampe> did you know you can beat eyedol on hardest difficulty in killer instinct
15:32 < vilxdryad> me too, on both n64 and emulator = )
15:32 < tischslampe> you actually _CAN_ it IS possible if you use combo and use the jump kick bug against him
15:32 < Schallwelle> of course, i did it, malmang

15:33 < tischslampe> you take away like 0.1% with that attack, but use it 1000 times and he's dead
15:33 < Schallwelle> not even too long ago... killer instinct is fairly easy , mortal kombat (III) is hard
15:33 < tischslampe> eyedol always blocks but never charges

15:34 <@Savestate> geeze, i need to stop biting at my fingers, my index finger looks like a war zone
15:34 < Schallwelle> i know that feel, but i stopped it after over 10 years
15:34 < vilxdryad> i did time ago

15:42 < Yuki-chan> Good article!
15:42 < tischslampe> yes
15:42 < tischslampe> i like the "The alcohol in them could make 400 trillion trillion pints of beer. Unfortunately, it’s about 10,000 light years away. But this is proof that the universe is PRO-drinking."
15:43 < tischslampe> beer fucks up my sleep though
15:43 < tischslampe> i fall asleep fast but i don't sleep for long, or well
15:43 < tischslampe> :[
15:43 < Yuki-chan> Yeah
15:43 < Yuki-chan> I actually can't read this because I have buzzfeed blocked
15:44 < tischslampe> darn
15:44 < Yuki-chan> Probably because it's a third party clickbait spammer
15:44 < Ryaan2000> THey need to discover a cloud of marijuana in space for people to get really excited
15:44 < golgi> bad article because it's buzzfeed

15:44 < golgi> buzzfeed is cancer as hell
15:44 < Yuki-chan> haha ;)
15:44 < golgi> i know beer is objectively bad because buzzfeed wrote an article praising it

15:47  * vilxdryad expecting
15:47 < Ryaan2000> bahaha
15:47 < Schallwelle> B)
15:48 < Schallwelle> fyi yuki-chan i've been playing super metroid since.....age 7 or something
15:48 < Yuki-chan> Unfortunately Schallwelle does not play eroges : (
15:48 < Yuki-chan> Instead he does really gay things like speedrunning
15:48 < Schallwelle> i'm not even speedrunning You dong
15:48 < vilxdryad> i play actually play dramatical murder on pc
15:48 < Ryaan2000> omg you've been playing since 7 but are still on Norfair
15:48 < Schallwelle> run =/= speedrun =)
15:48 < vilxdryad> play pls
15:48 < Schallwelle> yes Ryan
15:48 < vilxdryad> lol
15:48 < Schallwelle> actually i'm in maridia now but eh
15:48 < vilxdryad> one does not simply norfair
15:49 < Schallwelle> i'm still playing with the SAME controller
15:49 < Schallwelle> the very same one i used when i played it for the first time
15:49 < Schallwelle> =')
15:49 < Ryaan2000> also wtf how does this chipbattle thing work
15:49 < sincx> "Beer even hydrates “slightly better” than water." Bull Shit
15:49 < Ryaan2000> how do you do lsdj live like that, it takes me a day just to play out my melody and stuff in fami
15:49 < vilxdryad> just like guitar battles; it do not
15:50 < vilxdryad> x2 lol
15:50 < Ryaan2000> I'm still on that chip thing puke linked
15:50 < Schallwelle> what i want to say is that , Yuki-chan , a) i certainly don't need savestates , and b) it wouldn't be a fun challenge if i did :D i do this stuff to keep the game being entertaining after almost 20 years!
15:50 < Schallwelle> 20 years and the same game is still interesting, man
15:50 < Ryaan2000> man where is savestate when you need him
15:50 < Yuki-chan> Hmmm~
15:50 < vilxdryad> so much x2 very wow
15:50 < Ryaan2000> That sexy, sexy deer
15:51 < Schallwelle> the only thing that bothers me is there aren't music replacement tools already
15:51 < vilxdryad> i still can not manage myself to get the 100% of it
15:51 < Schallwelle> super metroid could use custom music for hacks
15:51 < Schallwelle> addmusick for super metroid when
15:51 <@Savestate> what's up Ryaan2000 
15:51 < Yuki-chan> Schallwelle, learn programming instead >:)
15:51 < Ryaan2000> what
15:51 < Yuki-chan> And you can make that dream come true~
15:51 <@Savestate> oh, haah
15:51 < Schallwelle> nope i'm not learning snes
15:51 < Schallwelle> forget it lmao
15:51 < Ryaan2000> I was just making a joke about people needing savestates :P
15:51 <@Savestate> ok nevermind, i thought you needed me
15:51 < Yuki-chan> But then again
15:52 < Ryaan2000> we all need you :P
15:52 < Yuki-chan> How would you get it onto a cartridge
15:52 < sincx> the channel can always use a bit of savestate!!
15:52 < vilxdryad> super metroid with some snes metal-ambiented tracks... op
15:52 < Schallwelle> flash carts? 
15:52 < Schallwelle> Yuki-chan did You never hear of the everdrives
15:52 < Schallwelle> wow
15:52 < Joltik> but savestate you are the dragonborn we need you
15:52 < Yuki-chan> Yeah, but you might as well use an emulator then!
15:52 < Schallwelle> pfff
15:52 < Yuki-chan> I have only heard of the word
15:52 < Yuki-chan> It would be cool if flash carts had built-in savestates
15:52 < Schallwelle> bad words You heard
15:52 < Schallwelle> haha
15:53 < Schallwelle> there is hardware to do that
15:53 < Ryaan2000> This guy in the chipbattle thing is using the same chord progression (nearly) that "Danger! High Voltage!" uses
15:53 < Schallwelle> savestates on real systems are a thing
15:53 < vilxdryad> Savestate, the mighty dragon warrior
15:53 < Joltik> what if savestate actually was dragonborn tho
15:53 -!- charlotte [~charlotte@cpc73876-salf5-2-0-cust428.10-2.cable.virginm.net] has quit [Read error: Connection reset by peer]
15:53 < Schallwelle> but a) hardware probably fucking rare and expensive and b) well... i don't like savestates :D for programming/hacking purposes it could be very handy tho!
15:54 < Joltik> and then i imagined a deer going around shouting at ppl
15:54 <@Savestate> i would fly around cause im a dragon (super cool)
15:54 < vilxdryad> yea, is pretty cool to test with it
15:54 < Schallwelle> i need a REAL sms flash cart, ie "devcart"
15:54 < Schallwelle> so i can compile directly into it
15:54 < Ryaan2000> hmmm
15:54 < Schallwelle> not run around with the goddamn SD cards from laptop to console and back
15:54 < Schallwelle> lmao
15:55 < Yuki-chan> Emulators are especially handy for development and debugging
15:55 < Ryaan2000> you should be lucky lol
15:55 < Schallwelle> i will not program a game and only debug in emulators
15:55 < Ryaan2000> you couldn't do that in the 1980s
15:55 < Schallwelle> never trust the emulator solely
15:55 < Yuki-chan> Of course
15:55 < Schallwelle> unless You want to make cool games that only run in emus :')
15:55 < vilxdryad> i would just dance around cause im a tree (super nintendo)
15:56 < Schallwelle> ah ok let's distinguish debug and testing here
15:56 < Schallwelle> flash cart for testing when it's seemingly bug free
15:56 < Schallwelle> haha
15:56 < Yuki-chan> Emulators have gotten a lot better as well
15:56 < Schallwelle> what, nes emulators?
15:56 < Schallwelle> thx
15:56 < Schallwelle> \o/
15:56 < Yuki-chan> If it works on an emulator, it's very likely to work on hardware
15:57 < Schallwelle> yes =)
15:57 < Yuki-chan> I never said you shouldn't test on hardware at all
15:57 < Schallwelle> but many emulators are limited and or buggy, because they revolve around games that already exist
15:58 < Schallwelle> and are optimized to play back those, and not just be a perfect emulation of the system
15:58 < Schallwelle> emulating the quirks and ticks of a system is important as well imo XD
15:58 < Yuki-chan> Yes, emulator devs know that
15:58 < Schallwelle> some implement it =))
15:58 < Schallwelle> or, as much as they can, hah
15:59 < Schallwelle> i wouldn't wonder if fceux can do it
15:59 < Schallwelle> ok i waited for 5 minutes now and the crabs don't emerge wow, how am i supposed to climb up the frosted crabs if they don't show up
15:59 < Yuki-chan> [20:54:49] <Schallwelle> not run around with the goddamn SD cards from laptop to console and back
15:59 < Yuki-chan> Doing this every single time though
15:59 < Yuki-chan> is baka
16:00 < Yuki-chan> baka no aho-chan!
16:00 < Schallwelle> what, i do have to do this until now
16:00 < Yuki-chan> It's alright to do it regularly
16:00 < Yuki-chan> What do you think you have to do this every single time?
16:00 < Schallwelle> slimbol-san have You ever heard of real(TM) flash carts(C) ?
16:01 < Yuki-chan> Yes
16:01 < Schallwelle> with a little bit of swaggery You can set up Your stuff to compile directly into them
16:01 < Schallwelle> lel
16:01 < Yuki-chan> Then go for that
16:01 < Schallwelle> yes, obviously
16:01 < Schallwelle> because, like i said
16:01 < Schallwelle> <Schallwelle> not run around with the goddamn SD cards from laptop to console and back
16:01 < Schallwelle> XD
16:01 < Yuki-chan> Just use an emulator
16:02 < Schallwelle> i won't for a real big game
16:02 < Schallwelle> for little stuff, and simple stuff, yes
16:02 < Schallwelle> but not for a big project
16:02 < Yuki-chan> I would suggest it especially for a big project
16:02 < Schallwelle> i won't risk anything just because i was too lazy and only tested in an emulator lmao
16:02 < Yuki-chan> That's an irrational fear
16:02 < Schallwelle> dude i DO use an emulator o_O
16:02 < Schallwelle> wtf are You trying to achieve by discussing with me now :D
16:03 < Yuki-chan> Maybe you know something I don't
16:03 < Schallwelle> i just like to be secured , so that i don't write 1000000000000000000000 lines of code and then it doesn't work onn the actual system :D
16:03 < Schallwelle> there are a number of sms demos that DONT work on the real system
16:03 < Schallwelle> guess why :D
16:04 < Yuki-chan> Would it be disaster if you found out that something you made works perfectly on an emulator, but not on the real system?
16:04 < Schallwelle> same goes for nes stuff at times
16:04 < Schallwelle> yes
16:04 < Schallwelle> otherwise i could just use rpg maker
16:04 < Schallwelle> lmao
16:04 < Yuki-chan> Why is it a disaster
16:04 < Schallwelle> i only do it so i can play it on the real system
16:04 < Schallwelle> it's all about my fetish
16:04 < Schallwelle> =)
16:04 < Yuki-chan> Or is it all about your allergy?
16:05 < Schallwelle> what are You doing in here, trying to talk bullshit into people's heads when they like real hardware more than emulation
16:05 < Schallwelle> go to a GXSCC chat and do it there lmao
16:05 < Schallwelle> i'm not 'allergic' to emulators ok
16:05 < Schallwelle> xD
16:06 < Yuki-chan> You distrust them too much
16:06 < jaemie> > go to a GXSCC chat and do it there lmao
16:06 < Schallwelle> i distrust the triangle of me, emulator and real system
16:06 < jaemie> the thought of an actual GXSCC community scares me
16:06 < Schallwelle> there can be a flaw in one of those three but all must be perfect
16:06 < Schallwelle> so gods temple can be just
16:06 < Schallwelle> hahahahahah jaemie
16:07 < Schallwelle> well there could be a funny gxscc community trying to fuck up the program, hack it, etcc
16:07 < Schallwelle> trying to achieve weird sounds by doing this or that
16:07 < Schallwelle> haha
16:07 < Yuki-chan> GXSCC should be a format on BotB
16:08 < Schallwelle> it would be fun , definitely
16:08 < Schallwelle> the shittiest ohbs ever
16:08 < Schallwelle> hahaha

17:08 < Schallwelle> ...
17:08 < Yuki-chan> because the dynamic between you, me and sincx is a lot like yuyshiki
17:08 < Marysia> you should not watch anime
17:08 < Schallwelle> i wouldn't watch an anime that yuki-chan is suggesting
17:08 < Marysia> especially when a polish guy recommends it
17:08 < Schallwelle> poles are the most hardcore weeaboos tbh
17:09 < Marysia> because youre going to conflict a jailbaited fanbase
17:09 < Jimmyoshi> Genre	Comedy, Slice of life
17:09 < Jimmyoshi> oh this doesn't seem bad
17:09 < Yuki-chan> Yeah
17:09 < Schallwelle> i thought south americans and southeast asians were the worst weeaboos
17:09 < Schallwelle> but poles are more hardcore
17:09 < Yuki-chan> At least one of A-zu-ra's butt pictures is from there ;)
17:09 < Jimmyoshi> " The story follows a group of three girls who join their high school's Data Processing Club. As the story unfolds it becomes readily apparent that the trio's methods of "processing data" are quite loose indeed, often to humorous effect."

17:09 < Marysia> http://puu.sh/nOZVo/a9ca7fd1d8.png SSH y u no fancy bent text
17:10 < Jimmyoshi> I wonder how they... "process data"
17:10 < Yuki-chan> Synopsis rarely ever explains a slice of life well
17:10 < Yuki-chan> But yeah you should watch it because you are just like yui
17:10 < Schallwelle> the guy from 'she' is a pole and probably one of the hardest weebs i ever saw

17:15 < Minigunner> just a first step
17:15 < Jimmyoshi> being fertile is overrated
17:15 < Yuki-chan> Yeah
17:15 < Schallwelle> i can agree on that Marysia
17:15 < Minigunner> well, you know where the cis girls are?
17:15 < Yuki-chan> Schallwelle, why do you want babbies so badly
17:15 < Minigunner> out in the real world
17:15 < Marysia> 22:15 < Minigunner> well, you know where the cis girls are?
17:15 < Marysia> in the past.
17:15 < Ryaan2000> you have to remember guys in skirts is a longstanding tradition of gay culture which dates back to the 19th century at lesat
17:15 < Schallwelle> i like babies if they're mine!

17:16 < NerdMcBoon> What is this "real world" you are talking about?

17:16 < Jimmyoshi> idk, some strange realm that exists outside of the internet
17:16 < Marysia> nah
17:16 < Marysia> its shit
17:16 < Marysia> wouldnt recommend
17:16 < Schallwelle> sadly the real world women don't REALLY like all that geeky stuff, and if they do, they are 100% in a partnership already ;)
17:16 < Marysia> people there punch you
17:16 < Minigunner> the internet has so many trans women on it because they aren't able to be out there
17:17 < Marysia> Mnigunner
17:17 < Minigunner> because, well, obvious reasons
17:17 < Marysia> look
17:17 < Marysia> as rules of the internet say
17:17 < Marysia> every woman on the internet is a guy and every child is an fbi agent
17:17 < Marysia> so
17:17 < Marysia> few guys had to adapt.
17:17 < Marysia> sacrifice for the majority.
17:17 < Yuki-chan> haha
17:17 < Marysia> the problem is
17:17 < Marysia> the "few" is growing too fast
17:18 < Marysia> this
17:18 < Marysia> thus
17:18 < Yuki-chan> !this
17:18 < SaveyBot> ~ 8===============D
17:18 < Marysia> man power is being weakened in the internet
17:18 < Marysia> and feminists are taking over
17:18 < Marysia> demanding fake equality
17:18 < Marysia> and those feminists
17:18 < Marysia> can be easily controlled my small groups of 4chan troops (remember racist AC thingy?)
17:19 < Marysia> internet is now a huge mess

17:21 < Schallwelle> the only geeky women i see these days in the internet are either a) lesbian, b) taken or c) both
17:21 < Jimmyoshi> and don't get me wrong, there's a good number of geeky girls there who are also in CS
17:22 < Jimmyoshi> but proportionally it's like

17:25 < Schallwelle> B)
17:25 < Yuki-chan> North Korea
17:25 < Yuki-chan> It is just.
17:25 < vilxdryad> they are all cute, but i prefer men because they nature is beneficial than the counter side, even so; whose that actually attract me are few and close to none for utopic reasons
17:25 < Schallwelle> Kim Il-Sung's Korea is perfectly just 
17:25  * Schallwelle kickbanned
17:26 < Ryaan2000> oh yes north korea is a wonderful place
17:26 < Schallwelle> i like tomboys tbh, because their brains are different
17:26 < vilxdryad> north is a wonderful cardinal
17:26 < Ryaan2000> what with the starvation, lack of freedom of speech, and concentration work camps
17:26 < Schallwelle> i don't like tomboys with foul mouths but i like them in general
17:26 < Jimmyoshi> tomboys are cute
17:26 < Yuki-chan> We like tomboys, but we lack the enlightenment to like traps
17:26 < Schallwelle> 'enlightenment' lamo
17:26 < Yuki-chan> ;)
17:26 < Ryaan2000> not to mention constant threats of war to other countries and shit talking US. But nobody wants to do anything because... China

17:27 < Ryaan2000> if your porn links are to be believed vilx
17:27 < vilxdryad> this is not Dungeons and dragons
17:27 < Schallwelle> You should just accept that some people have another orientation and don't feel personally attacked, Yuki-chan
17:27 < Schallwelle> =)
17:27 < Schallwelle> You're cute for a trap!
17:27 < Schallwelle> lolo
17:27 < Yuki-chan> wow~
17:27 < Jimmyoshi> people should just like whatever gender/sex they prefer imo
17:27 < Schallwelle> yes lol
17:28 < Schallwelle> i think that would be great
17:28 < Schallwelle> lol
17:28 < Jimmyoshi> if you like traps, great! if you don't, also great!
17:28 < vilxdryad> i do
17:28 < Schallwelle> i'm half greek so i have tolerance in my genes hahahahaha
17:28 < Marysia> you are going to like traps if you dont want to be accused of intolerance!
17:28 < Yuki-chan> If you like geeky stuff, great! If you don't also great! (but ooooh so annoying!!!)
17:28 < vilxdryad> i also enjoy to see yiff yaoi drawings and that does not mean anything else than that

18:12 < Schallwelle> :D

18:21 < R3M> see if you're convinced
18:21 < Yuki-chan> A slick video showing off a fancy gadget or two and arbitrary percentages will convince a lot of people
18:22 < R3M> Yuki-chan, nope that's not all there is
18:22 < Yuki-chan> Essentially it's just like politics
18:22 < R3M> come on now
18:22 < R3M> step down from your throne lmfao
18:22 < R3M> and let a corporation do a good thing

18:24 < R3M> well you're acting so righteous 
18:24 < Jimmyoshi> the thing is we don't know
18:24 < Jimmyoshi> and we shouldn't assume either one
18:24 < Yuki-chan> I'm skeptical
18:24 < Jimmyoshi> nothing wrong with skepticism!
18:24 < R3M> Jimmyoshi, it's unlikely because *the lie would be found out and they would get shit for it* do you people not get that
18:24 < Yuki-chan> What kind of shit though?
18:24 < Yuki-chan> If not many people find it out, there's not much shit
18:24 < Yuki-chan> People will keep buying anyway
18:24 < R3M> Yuki-chan, no, you're hard-lining, corporations never tell the truth or give accurate numbers
18:25 < Yuki-chan> I never said that
18:25 < R3M> when in the us they are required by law to give accurate numbers
18:25 < R3M> maybe you didn't know that
18:25 < Yuki-chan> I do think that they like to bend the truth in a way that makes them look good
18:25 < Yuki-chan> Yes, their financial reports are accurate
18:26 < R3M> any numbers that would have an impact on someone buying stock or not pretty much need to be accurate
18:26 < Yuki-chan> They just need to look as positive as possible
18:26 < R3M> yes, they do
18:26 < Yuki-chan> They're only accurate when the US law requires them
18:26 < R3M> sure
18:26 < Yuki-chan> You can say you're 93% renewable. US law doesn't require you to specify that.
18:27 < R3M> oh my god you're ridiculous

18:42 < FL4SHK> I don't know why
18:42 < FL4SHK> but it's how English works
18:42 < vilxdryad> amazing ty a lot FL4SHK = D
18:42 < FL4SHK> It's a simple rule; I hope you remember it :P
18:43 < FL4SHK> English is not a well-designed language
18:43 < vilxdryad> it is like the templeOS of the languages
18:43 < Yuki-chan> What is a better designed language?
18:43 < FL4SHK> Probably an "artificial" language
18:43 < Yuki-chan> What languages do you know besides English?
18:44 < FL4SHK> Other than programming languages, none
18:44 < Ordinate> jack me off with your feet
18:44 < vilxdryad> spanish has a lot of rules
18:44 < vilxdryad> i can say that is the hardest of languages
18:44 < FL4SHK> but I did learn a little Spanish and Japanese (more so the former)
18:44 < Yuki-chan> !
18:44 < Jimmyoshi> I can program in Japanese
18:44 < Jimmyoshi> I can't speak C++ though

18:45 < FL4SHK> Joshi
18:45 < vilxdryad> lol
18:45 < vilxdryad> how can one program in japanese?
18:45 < FL4SHK> uh
18:45 < vilxdryad> and why? the program just can be weighter
18:45 < Yuki-chan> I should've said 嘘　instead
18:46 < FL4SHK> Most programming languages use English words
18:46 < vilxdryad> and a lot more unstable
18:46 < FL4SHK> since the English speakers are the ones who invented them... mostly
18:46 < vilxdryad> because of that same ^

20:38 < Jimmyoshi> I don't use it for my irl email tho
20:38 < Jimmyoshi> my irl email is gmail
20:38 < Bozikek> outlook is less horrible then it use to be
20:38 <@Savestate> i just, i haven't heard of anyone using it since 2000 that wasn't using it for work
20:38 < Jimmyoshi> lol well it's because I used to use msn
20:38 < FL4SHK> ew msn
20:38 < Schallwelle> yes msn
20:38 < Jimmyoshi> but then it died
20:38 <@puke7> wish i would have hooked up my nimboxx email to my gmail so i still had some of it
20:38 < Jimmyoshi> rip
20:39 < Schallwelle> rip msn
20:39 < Yuki-chan> I used to use hotmail, but the new Outlook Office 365 creative cloud shit nuked my inbox
20:39 <@Savestate> god, get gmail dude
20:39 < Jimmyoshi> MSN > skype
20:39 < Jimmyoshi> Savestate: I do have gmail!
20:39 < Jimmyoshi> ...for my irl email

20:39 < Schallwelle> in real life
20:39 < Yuki-chan> のidea
20:39 < Jimmyoshi> it means the email I use for irl sht??
20:39 <@puke7> anyone want a @battleofthebits.org email address??  xD
20:39 < FL4SHK> why would you use email for non-IRL stuff
20:39 < Yuki-chan> puke7, sure!
20:39 <@Savestate> woah, @battleofthebits.org would be so cool
20:40 < Jimmyoshi> FL4SHK: why would I not separate irl with non-irl?

20:40 < FL4SHK> yeah your name isn't even Jimmy
20:40 < gyms> lol do it
20:40 <@Savestate> FL4SHK: he probably uses it for all the furry websites he's secretly a part of
20:40 < FL4SHK> so it wouldn't make sense even
20:40 < Yuki-chan> Jimmy65816 looks more professional, I admit

21:56 < Jimmyoshi> FL4SHK this is something that needs not be said
21:56 < Jimmyoshi> it's like saying "the sky is blue"
21:56 < Jimmyoshi> uhh google translate I'm pretty sure dokidoki != throb....
21:56 < Joltik> or "jimmyoshi likes panflutes"
21:57 < Schallwelle> http://redskysoftware.com/assets/img/red_sky.jpg
21:57 < Yuki-chan> dokidoki = heart throb yes
21:57 < Yuki-chan> It is an onomatopoeia for heart throb???
21:57 < Jimmyoshi> wtf I thought it just meant excited
21:57 < Jimmyoshi> or something
21:57 < Yuki-chan> Yes
21:57 < Yuki-chan> It means that too
21:57 < Jimmyoshi> japan's weird
21:57 < FL4SHK> Japanese has completely phonetic spelling
21:57 < RatShack> why don't they just use "hunk" and keep things simple
21:57 < FL4SHK> and that is a great thing
21:57 < Joltik> doki doki heart-pounding excitement
21:57 < FL4SHK> That's an awful thing about English
21:58 < Jimmyoshi> FL4SHK: yeah, but the kanji writing system sucks haha
21:58 < Schallwelle> dokidoki is an omononmomnomonommoonmomnonmononomatopopopipapepopupeia yes that is correct ok gtfo wow lame ha ond
21:58 < FL4SHK> Yeah Kanji is stupid
21:58 < Schallwelle> kanji is good
21:58 < Jimmyoshi> and the fact that there's a shitton of context-sensitive homonyms
21:58 < FL4SHK> oh
21:58 < FL4SHK> that's bad
21:58 < FL4SHK> the phonetic spelling is good

21:59 < Jimmyoshi> (if you translate that to japanese you'll see why :) )
21:59 < FL4SHK> wait

21:59 < Jimmyoshi> bread = pan....

22:03  * Jimmyoshi steals Joltik's cheesecake
22:03  * Jimmyoshi drops the cheesecake
22:03 < Joltik> too late

22:03 < Joltik> so you fail the test
22:03 <@aji> so if you go to bed at 9pm tonight, you'll be going to bed at 69:00 on saturday
22:03 < Yuki-chan> FL4SHK, you are racist towards the japanese!
22:03 < Yuki-chan> >:(
22:03  * Joltik locks Jimmyoshi in a dark room

22:07 < Yuki-chan> lol
22:07 < Schallwelle> good
22:07 < RatShack> Both, that's the problem.  Atari 5200 is 6502, Sega Master System is Z80, NES is 6502, Game boy is Z80
22:08 < RatShack> prob going to go for SMS first
22:08 < Jimmyoshi> Joltik wtf
22:08 < Schallwelle> heh i had an SMS first, then SNES and GB, and NES muuch later
22:08 < Jimmyoshi> I mean.............
22:08 < Jimmyoshi> I probably wouldn't hate it......
22:08 < Joltik> fl4shk loves ぼくのぴこ
22:08 < Yuki-chan> ;)
22:08 < Joltik> huehuehue
22:08 < Schallwelle> actually i had my first sms with 4 and my first nes with 16 lmao
22:08 < Yuki-chan> hahaha
22:09 < Schallwelle> my father worked for a company that took out stuff of houses etc when someone went to senior care or died
22:09 < Schallwelle> and one time someone actually wanted to throw a nes away
22:09 < Schallwelle> so he took it home obviously
22:09 < Schallwelle> xD
22:09 < jaemie> dude that nes is haunted
22:09 < RatShack> that NES is haunted
22:09 < Yuki-chan> hahaha
22:09 < jaemie> by old people ghost
22:09 < Schallwelle> lol
22:09 < jaemie> oh gg
22:09 < Schallwelle> idc =)
22:10 < Schallwelle> i guess there is no ghost, or if, then it's a helpful spirit
22:10 < Schallwelle> because i honor that nes ok!!
22:10 -!- A-zu-ra is now known as A-zu-ra|DC
22:10 < bazz> Y'all be forgetting about the Ti-83 plus, also Z80 :)
22:10 < RatShack> You need to give it a blood sacrifice every once in a while or you will have bad RNG's forever
22:10 < Schallwelle> i played zelda 2 on it nonstop with an ex sitting on my lap 24/7 wow that was cool
22:10 < Yuki-chan> ;)
22:11 < Joltik> srsly pc8801 z80
22:11 < Yuki-chan> Z80, the mainstay of eroges
22:11 < Schallwelle> wtf pc88 uses z80?
22:11 < Schallwelle> nice
22:11 < Yuki-chan> The very early models do
22:11 < RatShack> I had a TI-82, dang kids and their fancy 83+'s.
22:12 < chunter> Z80 has a bigger instruction set than 6502
22:12 < bazz> ^_^
22:12 < chunter> once i learned 6502 I wished I'd have had a 6502 based home computer in my childhood
22:12 < Schallwelle> they say 6502 is the easiest, then Z80, then the rest
22:12 < bazz> I used z80 as a stepping stone to 6502/65816
22:12 < chunter> Z80 is closed to intel 8086 and such
22:12 < RatShack> I should just jump straight into 68000
22:13 < chunter> that is, closer
22:13 < Schallwelle> :D
22:13 < bazz> I tried jumping straight into 65816 / SNES ... but the complexity was too high for me.. 
22:13 < bazz> saddles into Z80 / Ti-83p and Gameboy
22:13 < RatShack> well that's cause sega does what nintendon't
22:13 < Joltik> pc98 8086 iirc
22:13 < Jimmyoshi> 65816 is not a fun language
22:13 < Jimmyoshi> do not recommend
22:13 < Yuki-chan> ;)
22:14 < bazz> Jimmyoshi: I love it now <3
22:14 < Jimmyoshi> rip :(
22:14 < bazz> certainly more than x86
22:14 < Jimmyoshi> I haven't tried x86 lol
22:14 < Joltik> jimmyoshi will learn x86 and become pc98 eroge master
22:14 < Yuki-chan> x86 is alright

22:15 < RatShack> you just need to poke the right nibble and you're good
22:15 < Schallwelle> do it do it do it
22:16 < Schallwelle> Joltik i'm sure You'd learn very fast

22:30 < Ordinate> http://puu.sh/nPkhs/83f4a423b9.png this thing
22:30 <@puke7> depends on your tempo setting and frame setting
22:30 <@puke7> if your frame setting isn't set to 6 then you need to do maths to adjust your tempo setting
22:30 < Ordinate> speed2
22:30 <@puke7> oh gawd
22:30 <@puke7> yer not using 60Hz either
22:30 <@puke7> more maths
22:30 < Ordinate> 25hz actually
22:30 < Ordinate> oh wait you can read lol whoops
22:31 <@puke7> this isn't ft then right?  00c?

22:33 < Schallwelle> ah storbe did
22:33 < Schallwelle> Joltik You are wrong remove Yourself
22:33 < Joltik> make kicks on pattern, render to wav, open in fl as audio clip/sampler channel, right click, detect bpm

22:33 < Schallwelle> fuck
22:33 < Joltik> i win
22:33 < Ordinate> not bad, i like fast

22:37 < frantic> Jimmyoshi, how can you possibly thing feminists are dumber than MRAs
22:37 < Joltik> lel schall idk why it doesnt
22:37 < Jimmyoshi> frantic: have you *seen* some of the shit they've said?
22:37 < Jimmyoshi> granted, they're both dumb
22:37 < Jimmyoshi> but feminists are much more of a threat
22:37 < Joltik> just drag and drop into a sampler channel, right click the audio wave that you see
22:37 < Joltik> there should be a detect tempo button
22:37 < frantic> don't judge groups by their dumbest members
22:37 < Ordinate> joltik i already got the tempo
22:37 < frantic> that's sanity 101
22:38 < Jimmyoshi> touche
22:38 < Joltik> ordinate im talking to schallwelle you dong
22:38 < Ordinate> but joltik i already got the tempo
22:38 < Joltik> ffs that's not what I am talking about you ass
22:38 < Ordinate> but joltik dude i got the tempo already 
22:39 < frantic> at least there's an intellectual base for feminism what with women being second class citizens for most of human history
22:39 < Joltik> g fucking g
22:41 < RatShack> I just caught up on chat, can someone recommend me a custom hz nsf to use for testing

22:44 < Jimmyoshi> lol
22:44 < Jimmyoshi> what an oddly specific tempo
22:46 < Ordinate> ratshack: i'm testing out 25hz and i like it so far
