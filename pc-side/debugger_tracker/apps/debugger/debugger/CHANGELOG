  DSP window

  migrated to SDL2
  

  Added Blargg & I's personal SMOOTH_VOLUME DSP fix, to cut out annoying
  crackling that is notice-able with headphones on. This will become an
  optional setting down the line.. It's currently a compile-time feature

  masking is broken. Or something.   Maybe not

  Modded mouse hex dump display to be >writable< , made it scrollable too,
    with overflow rollover.
  Double Click Events

  Fixed PC Tracking

  The SPC RAM is only 0x10000 bytes, But vSPCPLAY was confusingly going out of the bounds of the RAM array and actually displaying parts of the PC program's memory XD. Fixed

  main()'s tmpbuf was too small causing Buffer Overflow at program startup. Fixed.. 

-- v1.3
  Added command line options to replace the unused bytes in a spc file by a given pattern. By doing
  this you can increase compressibility of files:
    --apply_mask_block  Apply the mask to the file (replace unused blocks(256 bytes) with pattern)
	--filler val        Set the pattern byte value. Use with the option above. Default 0 
	
  Also bundled tools to apply mask files to spc files in the utils/ subdir.

-- v1.2
  Added --status_line command line option (displays a status line in the
  terminal).
  Reads in the sample directory were not reported (Resulting in unusable
  masks)

-- v1.1
  Added --extra_time command line option
  Added --nice command line
  Win32 support, compiled with mingw

-- v1.0
  Initial release.
