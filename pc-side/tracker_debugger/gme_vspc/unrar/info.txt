Update 4:
-Re-arranged and titled songs in line with the Breath of Fire Special Box
-Added composer breakdown, based on Yasuaki "Bun Bun" Fujita's notes about the album

Update 3:
-Found the other unused song. (Thanks to Revenant on the forums!)
-Unused ambient track and one jingle added.

Update 2:
-Missing track added. Thanks to, uh, the GSF ripper, Saptapper, for
 ripping it from the GBA version, which in turn led me to find it in
 the SNES version. Perhaps the other "hidden" track from the GBA 
 version is here somewhere, too...?
-Added *real* composer names, not just silly Capcom nicknames.

Update:
Complete overhaul:
-Improved tracknames and order. (If they were based on an OST,
 I'm sorry, but it was all wrong and defied all in-game logic.)
-Duplicate ending track removed.
-Track times slightly tweaked.
-Composer info added, courtesy of the GBA re-release.
